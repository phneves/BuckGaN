abstract = {Electrifying transportation is a promising approach to alleviate the climate change issue. The adoption of electric vehicle into market has introduced significant impacts on various fields, especially the power grid. Various policies have been implemented to foster the electric vehicle deployment and the increasing trend of electric vehicle adoption in the recent years has been satisfying. The continual development of electric vehicle power train, battery and charger technologies have further improved the electric vehicle technologies for wider uptake. Despite the environmental and economical benefits, electric vehicles charging introduce negative impacts on the existing network operation. Appropriate charging management strategies can be implemented to cater for this issue. Furthermore, electric vehicle integration in the smart grid can bring many potential opportunities, especially from the perspective of vehicle-to-grid technology and as the solution for the renewable energy intermittency issue. This paper reviews the latest development in electric vehicle technologies, impacts of electric vehicle roll out and opportunities brought by electric vehicle deployment.}
